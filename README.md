# Sentiment Analysis for Reviews of Chartered Bus 

A charter bus is a private vehicle rental used by private groups to take them, and only them, to their destination. With a charter bus, your group has the vehicle to themselves and gets to customize their itinerary as much as theyâ€™d like. Charter buses typically feature perks like a driver, undercarriage storage space, onboard bathrooms, free WiFi, and more.
